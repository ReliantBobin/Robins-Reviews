        <p>
            Okay, so hello there! My name is Robin, I am currently working my way through a Level 7 HNC: Digital Design
            and Development (Games) course at Fife College. If I find the effort to complete this course, I might have a
            pretty good chance at being the first person in my family to get into university. Unfortunately, I am still
            pretty lost as to what I want to do at the end of my education as I have so many choices but I do have some
            ideas of trying to get into 3D modelling, preferably modelling cars or parts for cars, another option might
            be animation as I have always enjoyed watching animated movies and shows.
        </p>

            In my spare time I have decided to help out a friend of mine with the editing work for YouTube channel
            @Bugzy (quick plug) as he was finding it quite stressful with the amount of time it takes just to edit a
            20-minute video, I also enjoy playing video games if you didnâ€™t notice.

            game I should try playing.
