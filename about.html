                    Okay, so hello there! My name is Robin, I am currently working my way through a Level 7 HNC: Digital
                    Design and Development (Games) course at Fife College. If I find the effort to complete this course,
                    I might have a pretty good chance at being the first person in my family to get into university.
                    Unfortunately, I am still pretty lost as to what I want to do at the end of my education as I have
                    so many choices but I do have some ideas of trying to get into 3D modelling, preferably modelling
                    cars or parts for cars, another option might be animation as I have always enjoyed watching animated
                    movies and shows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time I have decided to help out a friend of mine with the editing work for YouTube
                    channel @Bugzy (quick plug) as he was finding it quite stressful with the amount of time it takes
                    just to edit a 20-minute video, I also enjoy playing video games if you didnâ€™t notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to drop a quick comment below, maybe suggesting something I should change on the website
                    or a game I should try playing.
