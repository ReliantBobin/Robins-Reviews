            My childhood and to this day, still one of my favourite games to zone out in and be in my own world filled
            of blocks and strange creatures, Minecraft. Playing this game since I was 10 years old, I have been blown
            up, fallen to my death and killed by the ender dragon way too many times than I would like to admit but 14
            years later and this game still gives me the same excitement and enjoyment I felt back when a group of
            friends and I decided to create our own YouTube channel and upload silly videos of us playing a game we all
            love.

            Minecraft might not be the game for everyone but I would still recommend you give it a try wither you are in
            your own survival world, building different block shaped structures in creative, or even finding a server to
            play mini games with friends.
