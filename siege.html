            Rainbow Six Siege… (Big sigh). This game has changed a lot since I first started playing in 2018. Having
            added a whole bunch of new characters you can chose from, updating maps the different maps that have been in
            the game since the beginning, adding new maps that I always struggle to learn callouts for, and finally
            creating new features to be added and most likely nerfed within the first week of them being released, this
            game honestly feels like it did from the beginning, which I can’t decided is a good or bad thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The worst thing about this game has to be the cheating though. Being a big deal in Siege for a while now,
            the cheating is really ruining the experience of the game and causing me to lose a lot of motivation to even
            play it. Unless Ubisoft end up releasing a better anti-cheat system, I don’t think this game will hold up
            much longer which is a shame considering the history is has behind its name.
