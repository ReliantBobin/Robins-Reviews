            <p class="intro">
                Welcome to my self made game review website! This website was made in phoniex using HTML and CSS during
                my HTML and CSS class. There are 3 different reviews throughout this website giving my thoughts of my
                childhood favourite, my sweatist and most frustrating fps, and a brand new release that seems to be
                causing some problems for the games buyers.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you can be bothered, feel free to have a read through these reviews and maybe even give your thoughts
                in a short comment on the about page which also gives you some more information about me and what I do.
